**IGF-Messari Commitments**

Consolidating Token Transparency and Reporting Standards Initiatives

Draft by: Miko Matsumura, Ryan Selkis, and Michael Golomb

Last Update: November 27, 2017

**Overview:**

We are collaborating with some of crypto&#39;s leading transparency advocates\* to build Messari, an open-source EDGAR database for cryptoassets. The project aims to create a much-needed, single source of truth for basic cryptoasset financial information that can be accessed by media, developers, investors, and regulators alike. We are currently recruiting _non-financial_ supporters to agree upon a universal basic disclosure template for new token projects.

The [ICO Governance Foundation](https://icogovernance.org/) (IGF), a new self-regulatory industry standards body, will provide and maintains an open voluntary public filing and registration protocol called **Form IGF-1** as well as a public registration database, which performs collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions. The IGF-1 protocol is designed to primarily to help investors understand basic token economic information: 1. Who gets paid; 2. By whom; 3. When and under what circumstances; 4. Why; 5. How do they get paid.

The IGF has proposed the filing of a token project&#39;s basic disclosure form, covering initially some 26 topics.   [Messari](https://medium.com/@twobitidiot/introducing-messari-an-open-source-edgar-database-for-cryptoassets-46fec1b402f6) and the IGF, will centrally manage the registry initially, but its contents will be made immediately available via a GPL. Our plan is to later transfer oversight and maintenance of the registry to a decentralized network.

Our initial ask is simple. To start, we are collecting: 1) Project descriptions (missions, org structures, and verified web addresses), 2) &quot;Cap table snapshots&quot; that outline a project&#39;s anticipated initial and fully-diluted token distribution, and 3) &quot;Token treasury&quot; policies that specify how a project plans to manage its fundraising balances and reserved tokens.

Amidst the speculative fervor for cryptoassets, it is critical we develop better transparency and self-regulatory standards for the ecosystem, and that we ensure projects follow through on their promises to backers. From these modest five point disclosures, we can build a robust, self-regulating registry of projects that promotes data standardization and consumer protection.

**Standards Body** : The ICO Governance Foundation (Miko Matsumura, Michael Golomb)

**Registry Manager** : Messari (Ryan Selkis)

**\*Supporting Orgs** : ConsenSys, Balanc3, Frontier, Token Filings, Token Foundry, TokenSoft, TruSet

[VERBAL/UNCONFIRMED - Aragon, Argon, Blockchain Capital, Blockstack, CoinFund, CoinList, Cosmos, Deloitte, Distributed Global, Libertus Capital, Polymath, PwC, Santiment, Token Alliance]

We have received tremendous interest and &quot;philosophical&quot; support for this project in a short period of time. Now we are ironing out the specific asks we would like to make of each project. The &quot;one pager&quot; below is an MVP on which we can build a universal token data library.

We estimate if will take ~1-2 hours to complete this initial disclosure document.

**0) Project Overview (Optional)**

Project Mission and Description

- ++1000 characters (e.g. wikipedia intro) - no marketing, no jargon; Messari team approves

Corporate Legal  Structure

- ++Who are the primary issuing and supporting organizations for the project?

- ++Where and how are these entities structured? Legal counsel contact info?
- ++Who controls and governs these entities? (Officers &amp; Board Members) Audit Committee?  Compensation Committee? Org Charter?

Verified Project Web Assets

- ++Project website, token sale site, github repo
- ++Social media links (twitter, telegram, reddit, slack, etc) - prevent spamming/phishing


**1) Envisioned Post-Token Issuance &quot;Cap Table&quot;**
Token Distribution &quot;Snapshot&quot;

- ++Date of token distribution and total funding raised by funding type
- ++Tokens authorized and outstanding by &quot;class&quot; (corporate reserves vs. foundation reserves, founder/ employee/ advisor, SAFT, public sale, etc.)
- ++Associated vesting and lock-up schedules per class of token
- ++Anticipated fully-diluted supply curves (e.g. [Filecoin illustration](https://coinlist.co/filecoin))


**2) Proceeds Management &amp; Custody Chain**

Operating Treasury Policies

- ++ETH, BTC, Fiat balances, hedging instruments for BTC/ETH?
- ++Liquidation plans to cover operating expenses

Token Treasury Policies

- ++Secondary sales rules (e.g. [XRP monthly liquidation windows](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-to-place-55-billion-xrp-in-escrow-to-ensure-certainty-into-total-xrp-supply/))
- ++Hedging instruments for reserved tokens?
- ++Disclosure rules for insider sales or purchases?

Budgeted and Authorized Distribution Pools

- ++Time frames, amounts, and type of distributions (periodic lockup release, one time lockup release, governed by smart contract, token vesting, milestone based, etc)
- ++What mechanism assures that proceeds flow according to the distribution budget?

Custody chain (OPTIONAL for **opsec and legal reasons)**

- ++Who controls the wallet that will receives funds? Who custodies reserve tokens?
- ++Do you have a formal compensation committee at the board level?  AA&#39;s Charter?

**3) Governance of amendments**

- ++WP at token issuance + all historical versions (link to where updates are posted)
- ++What is the mechanism used to file amendments to IGF-1 filing? (Voting? Quorum / majorities required for amendments?)

**4) Post-ICO Commitment to Financial Reporting**

- ++How frequently will you plan on filing ongoing financial reports (if at all)?
- ++Will these reports be filed into the Messari database? Where will they be posted?
- ++Will you conduct an annual audit? Who will conduct the audit?
